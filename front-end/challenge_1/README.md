# Challenge 1

Build a React application that consists of two routes. One to list products and one to show the product details.

The two routes should be:
- `/` - showing the list of products
- `/:id` - showing the product details

You will need to mock out the interaction with the backend API. One mock to return the schema and the others to return the product/s.

## Hints

To get a react app up and running quickly, we recommend [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
