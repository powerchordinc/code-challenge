# Code Challenge

We need to build a flexible site for displaying products using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/). The site takes a schema, and according to that schema, displays the appropriate products. 

## The Schema

The schema is just a json document that contains within it the rules necessary for displaying a document's attributes.

Within the `schema` there is an array of `fields` which each represent an attribute on the product data object. The `key` property of the field associates the product values with the schema's fields. Within the `types` directory for each challenge a flow definition exists for your reference.
