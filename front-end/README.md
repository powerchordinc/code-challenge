# Code Challenge

We need to build a flexible site for displaying products. The site takes a schema, and according to that schema, displays the appropriate products.

## The Schema

The schema is just a json document that contains within it the rules necessary for displaying a document's attributes.

Within the schema there is an array of fields which each represent an attribute on the product data object. You will also find a `types` directory within each `challenge_` directory that contains the flow definition for the schema.
